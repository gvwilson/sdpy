Many programmers believe they're more likely to write documentation and keep it up to date
if it is close to the code.
Tools that extract specially-formatted comments from code and turn them into documentation
have been around since at least the 1980s;
both [Sphinx][sphinx] and [MkDocs][mkdocs] are popular ones for Python.

Generating documentation isn't the same as checking code style,
but they share some tooling.
Let's start by building a `NodeVisitor` that extracts and saves docstrings:

[%inc doc_extract.py mark=start %]

The code to create a stack,
extract docstrings,
and save them in a dictionary should look familiar by now:

[%inc doc_extract.py mark=body %]

To format the docstrings,
we create a Markdown page with module, class, and function names as headers:

[%inc doc_format.py mark=format %]

If our input file looks like this:

[%inc doc_sample.py %]

then our output is:
{: .continue}

[%inc doc_sample.out %]

## Modifying Code {: #codegen-modify}

An AST is a data structure like any other,
which means we can modify it as well as inspecting it.
Let's start with this short program:

[%inc double_and_print.py %]

Its AST has two top-level nodes:
one for the function definition and one for the `print` statement.
We can duplicate the second of these and then [%g unparsing "unparse" %] the AST
to produce a new program:

[%inc unparse.py mark=modify %]
[%inc unparse_modified.out %]

To run our machine-generated program,
we have to compile the AST to bytecode
and tell Python to evaluate the result:

[%inc unparse.py mark=exec %]
[%inc unparse_exec.out %]

Duplicating a `print` statement isn't particularly useful,
but other applications of this technique let us do some powerful things.
Let's have another look at how Python represents a function call.
Our example is:

[%inc call.py %]

We parse it like this:
{: .continue}

[%inc inject.py mark=parse %]

and get this AST:
{: .continue}

[%inc inject_parse.out %]

But we don't have to parse text to create an AST:
it's just a bunch of objects,
so we can construct one by hand
that mirrors the structure shown above:

[%inc inject.py mark=make %]
[%inc inject_make.out %]

Alternatively,
we can find existing function definitions
and modify them programmatically:

[%inc inject.py mark=modify %]

To try this out,
here's a program that adds and doubles numbers:

[%inc add_double.py %]

The modified version is:
{: .continue}

[%inc inject_modified.out %]

So what exactly is `call`?
We want a "function" that keeps track of
how many times it has been passed different strings,
so we define a class with a `__call__` method
so that its instances can be used like functions:

[%inc inject.py mark=counter %]

Finally,
when we're evaluating the bytecode generated from our modified AST,
we pass in a dictionary of variable names and values
that we want to have in scope.
The result is exactly what we would get if we had defined all of this in the usual way:

[%inc inject.py mark=exec %]
[%inc inject_exec.out %]

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

### There's Such a Thing as "Too Clever"

Modifying code dynamically is the most powerful technique shown in this book.
It is also the least comprehensible:
as soon as the code you read and the code that's run can differ in arbitrary ways,
you have a maintenance headache and a security nightmare.
Limited forms of program modification,
such as Python's [metaclasses][py_metaclass] or decorators
give most of the power with only some of the headaches;
please use those rather than the magic shown above.

## Exercises

### Name Conversion {: .exercise}

Write a tool that find functions with pothole\_case names
and replaces them with CamelCase names,
then saves the resulting program as a legal Python file.
