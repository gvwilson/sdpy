[%fixme "create discrete event simulator" %] [%issue 56 %]

-   Basic ideas of discrete event simulation
-   `wait_and_work.py`: work a fixed time, wait a fixed time
-   `wait_work_record.py`: record events and display table of results
-   `multiprocess.py`: two independent processes
-   `wait_event.py`: one waits for the other to finish
    -   But events happen once
-   `producer_consumer.py`: eventually producer can only run as fast as consumer
