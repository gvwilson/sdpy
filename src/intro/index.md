The best way to learn design in any field
is to study examples [%b Schon1984 Petre2016 %],
and the most approachable examples are ones that readers are already familiar with.
These lessons therefore build small versions
of [tools that programmers use every day][programming_tools]
to show how experienced software designers think.
Along the way,
they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science
that many self-taught programmers haven't encountered.
We hope these lessons will help you design better software yourself,
and that if you know how programming tools work,
you'll be more likely to use them
and better able to use them well.

## Audience {: #intro-audience}

This learner persona [%b Wilson2019 %] describes who this book is for:

> *Maya has a master's degree in genomics.
> She knows enough Python to analyze data from her experiments,
> but struggles to write code other people can use.
> These lessons will show her how to design, build, and test large programs
> in less time and with less pain.*
> {: .continue}

Like Maya, you should be able to:
{: .continue}

-   Write Python programs using lists, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions.

-   Puzzle your way through Python programs that use [%i "class" "classes" %]
    and [%i "exception" "exceptions" %].

-   Run basic Unix shell commands like `ls` and `mkdir`.

-   Read and write a little bit of [%i "HTML" %].

-   Use [Git][git] to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know [the more obscure commands][git_man_page_generator].)

These chapters ([%f intro-syllabus %]) are also designed to help another persona:

> *Yim teaches two college courses on software development.
> They are frustrated that so many books talk about details but not about design
> and use examples that their students can't relate to.
> This book will give them material they can use in class
> and starting points for course projects.*

## The Big Ideas {: #intro-ideas}

Our approach to design is based on three big ideas.
First,
as the number of components in a system grows,
the complexity of the system increases rapidly
([%f intro-complexity %]).
However,
the number of things we can hold in working memory at any time
is fixed and fairly small [%b Hermans2021 %].
If we want to build large programs that we can understand,
we therefore need to construct them out of pieces
that interact in a small number of ways.
Figuring out what those pieces and interactions should be
is the core of what we call "design".

[% figure
   slug="intro-complexity"
   img="complexity.svg"
   alt="Complexity and size"
   caption="How complexity grows with size."
%]

Second,
"making sense" depends on who we are.
When we use a low-level language,
we incur the [%g cognitive_load "cognitive load" %]
of assembling micro-steps into something more meaningful.
When we use a high-level language,
on the other hand,
we incur a similar load translating functions of functions
into actual operations on actual data.

More experienced programmers are more capable at both ends of the curve,
but that's not the only thing that changes.
If a novice's comprehension curve looks like the lower one in [%f intro-comprehension %],
then an expert's looks like the upper one.
Experts don't just understand more at all levels of abstraction;
their *preferred* level has also shifted
so they find \\( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) easier to read
than the Medieval equivalent
"the side of the square whose area is the sum of the areas of the two squares
whose sides are given by the first part and the second part".
This curve means that for any given task,
the code that is quickest for a novice to comprehend
will almost certainly be different from the code that
an expert can understand most quickly.

   caption="Novice and expert comprehension curves."
%]

Our third big idea is that programs are just another kind of data.
Source code is just text,
which we can process like other text files.
Likewise,
a program in memory is just a data structure
that we can inspect and modify like any other.
Treating code like data enables us to solve hard problems in elegant ways,
but at the cost of increasing the level of abstraction in our programs.
Once again,
finding the balance is what we mean by "design".

## Formatting {: #intro-layout}

We display Python source code like this:

[%inc python_sample.py %]

and Unix shell commands like this:
{: .continue}

[%inc shell_sample.sh %]

Data files and program output are shown like this:
{: .continue}

[%inc data_sample.yml %]

[%inc output_sample.out %]

We use `...` to show where lines have been omitted,
and occasionally break lines in unnatural ways to make them fit on the page.
Where we do this,
we end all but the last line with a single backslash `\`.
Finally,
we show glossary entries in **bold text**
and write functions as `function_name` rather than `function_name()`.
The latter is more common,
but the empty parentheses makes it hard to tell
whether we're talking about the function itself
or a call to the function with no parameters.

## What People Are Saying {: #intro-praise}

Here's what people said about the JavaScript version of this book [%b Wilson2022a %]:

-   [Alberto Bacchelli][bacchelli_alberto]:
    I've been using this book to teach software design to an undergraduate class of 250 students,
    and the students and I love it!
    The positive impact of the book is evident from the improvements in student grades
    and the quality of their practical assignments,
    reflecting the substantial learning that's taking place.
    It's been a joy to see them feel so equipped and inspired.

-   [Naomi Ceder][ceder_naomi]:
    This is my new favorite book on the art of writing software.
    There is so much  to like about itâ€”the way it leads the reader to explore and develop their understanding,
    the choice of projects and examples,
    the clarity of the instruction,
    the Creative Commons license,
    and much more.
    It will be my first recommendation for people looking to really learn professional development,
    either on their own or in a classroom setting.

-   [Julia Ferraioli][ferraioli_julia]:
    Blending computer science with sound software engineering practices (with citations!)
    is difficult enough on its own,
    but this book guides the reader through practical design patterns that they can put into practice.
    The addition of historic anecdotes gives readers extra context for what they've learned
    and brings theory back to practice.

-   [Jennifer Moore][moore_jennifer]:
    The book is an excellent guide for anyone going from "just programming" to building larger projects.
    It's like a choose-your-own adventure,
    but the adventure is learning to build very complex software as a composition of much simpler patterns.

-   [Jenn Schiffer][schiffer_jenn]:
    This book is both a great refresher if you've not worked with Python in a long time,
    or your next textbook if you know just enough to be a little dangerous and want to level up.
    The exercises being tool-based means the experience gained will instantly feel applicable
    to whatever you end up using the language for.

-   [Sue Smith][smith_sue]:
    I know I can share this book with folk in the confidence that
    they'll get a guided experience that's both accessible and comprehensive,
    leaving them with real world software skills.
    Teaching using examples makes the techniques meaningful and tangible to the learner
    which is in itself a great motivator,
    and the use of tooling examples is a bonus.

-   [Chelsea Troy][troy_chelsea]:
    Rather than stacking up isolated examples divorced from practical use cases,
    this book teaches concepts the way we use them: in collaboration with one another.
    Filled with both pragmatic advice and juicy historical nuggets,
    this book just might manage to do the thing I've tried to do in classrooms for half a decade:
    transfer basic engineering skills
    while conveying what it's like to manage complex software projects.

-   [Hazel Weakly][weakly_hazel]:
    This is an absolutely marvelous book.
    Very rarely do insightful diagrams,
    contentious syntax disambiguation,
    and thoughtful attention to how humans learn and absorb information come together in a coherent package like this.
    It is exactly the sort of book I wish I'd had at the start of my programming journey;
    it would've saved me from countless lessons learned the hard way.
